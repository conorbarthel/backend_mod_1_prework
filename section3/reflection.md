## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1) Self-reflection is important for growth mindset. Think of how a project could have gone better. How could the process become more efficient, more collaborative, or more detailed.
2) Be open to suggestions and feedback. This is related to point 1, but shows that it is also important to take advantage of others feedback to facilitate reflection. By using peers, mentors, and students advice everyone has the ability to grow and become better.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am obsessed with progression, whether that is in sports, learning, or any other aspect of life. Seeing where I've come from and where I am now is immensely gratifying.

A weakness of mine in terms of growth mindset is that I can be results oriented. Sometimes I overvalue unideal outcomes and allow myself to overlook the progress that I am making.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is and unordered list of data that consists of key value pairs. Its data is accessed by calling on the keys.

An array is an ordered list of data. Its data is accessed by calling on position that an element is housed within the array.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```pet_store = {dog_food: 546, cat_food: 793, Kong_toys: 49}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
puts states["IA"]
```
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
puts states.keys
puts states.values
```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

If someone wanted to make a list of favorite_movies_by_genre a hash would be a great choice, because they could pull up the answer by genre by creating keys for each genre with values of their favorite movies in that genre. In this case a hash is better suited because the user can easily remember where to search for the data that they want to access. An array would be much harder to search for and access this data because of the ordered index.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

What is the preferred syntax for hashes : or =>?
