# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  puts "#{name}"
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def sum(a, b)
  puts a + b
end

sum(10, 5)
sum(4, 3)
sum(8, 123)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.

def combine_strings(string_1, string_2)
  puts "#{string_1} #{string_2}"
end

combine_strings("yes", "no")
combine_strings("hot", "cold")
combine_strings("in", "out")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
"I named the method 'combine_strings' which describes what the method is doing in as few characters
as possible while maintaining its meaning."
"I named the parameters 'string_1' and 'string_2' to be clear what kind of data the method is asking for."
end
